Homework Week 13 - Clicky-game 

### Overview

In this assignment we created the app called Bamazon. We created a memory game with React.  The user gets a list of images and needs to click on the images only once. Everytime an image is clicked, the score goes up by one and if an image is clicked twice they lose.
